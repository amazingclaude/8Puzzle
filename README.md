# Eight Puzzle problem
This project focus on the solving of eight puzzle game by using different searching method. The programming tool was __Python 3.6__. Although an sys.argv could be implemented, for the convenience of monitoring the result, such function was modified that the argument (e.g. complexity) should be input through a Python IDE. The default puzzle size was set as 3*3 dimension. 

## Running Instruction
Successfuly created Python Coding are:
1. BFSsearch.py
2. DFSsearch.py
3. IDSsearch.py
4. Astardistance.py (sum of distance approach)
To run the code, directly run the file. 

## Details

Among them, the IDSsearch.py is modified based on DFSsearch.py.

The data structure creation idea is modified based on Kunwar's Github project.[1]
